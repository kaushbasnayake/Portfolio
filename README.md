2.	Navigate to project directory: cd [Portfolio website] 
3.	Install dependencies: npm install

Deployment Process 
The deployment is fully automated through GitHub Actions. Every push to the 'main' branch triggers the deployment workflow, which builds the project and deploys it to the cloud platform.

Challenges Faced 
•	Merge Conflict Resolution:  We created and resolved a merge conflict to practice professional Git collaboration workflows.
•	CI/CD Configuration:  Setting up GitHub action workflow files to ensure successful builds and deployments was a significant learning challenge.
